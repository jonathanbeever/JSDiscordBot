# JSDiscordBot
This JS project asks a Discord bot to respond to a keyword.


The goal of this project was to create a network of "theory bots" which would pull phrases from philosophical theorists and put them in conversation.
Early iterations named arrays, called up a bot in Discord, and started work on "hearing" keywords from one array and responding with a keyword from another.
The current iteration concatenates random items from two arrays, enabling the bot to mix voices of two theorists.
The basic structure can be modifed as needed for other approaches.
